Task Manager
============

User should be able to:
-  register in system
-  login into system
-  add new task
-  edit task
-  delete task
-  share task (share using email of another user in the system who will be also able to manage task afterwards )
-  see list of tasks ( list should auto-update when someone shares tasks with user; in the list user should see who has shared task)

_Use Twitter Bootstrap for UI, please (or something analogical). Cover code by Rspec tests, preferably_
