Task Manager
============

User should be able to:
-  `[x]` register in system
-  `[x]` login into system
-  `[x]` add new task
-  `[x]` edit task
-  `[x]` delete task
-  `[x]` share task (share using email of another user in the system who will be also able to manage task afterwards )
-  `[x]` see list of tasks
  -  `[ ]` list should auto-update when someone shares tasks with user
  -  `[ ]` in the list user should see who has shared task
    
_Use Twitter Bootstrap for UI, please (or something analogical). Cover code by Rspec tests, preferably_
